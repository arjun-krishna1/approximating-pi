# What is the project?
- I am building an application to visualize the accuracy and speed of various Pi Approximation algorithms
- I have always been fascinate by Pi, a number that can't fully be expressed by our number system
- The fact that we have proven that it can never be fully expressed is fascinating
- It is an unknowable entity

# Formulae for Approximating Pi

## The Madhava-Leibniz series

## Error
- This series, if truncated after certain numbers of digits, will be identical to π for many digits, but select groups of digits will be wrong[1].
- This error can be approximated by a formula, which is not included here but is included in the wikipedia article[1].

# Visualization
- A plot
  - y axis is the value of the digit (0 - 9)
  - x value is the digit
